# Timmy-Toms
Timmy Tom’s Gourmet Sandwiches is a rapid service restaurant that serves sandwiches, subs, beverages, and other side dishes such as chips and desserts. Timmy Tom’s was on an expansion path and rapid growth in their key markets up until March of 2020. By that point of time, Timmy Tom’s had infiltrated the market with locations that were considered high-revenue and easy-win over their competitors. Around the same time, a global pandemic, COVID-19, hindered any plans for further growth or expansion. This global crisis forced Timmy Tom’s to switch the direction of their expansion strategy into a more conservative approach of extreme caution of any new stores being opened. After a year, Timmy Tom’s is confident that it can continue its expansion strategy as long as we are able to identify locations with really strong revenue potential. Therefore, we have been provided with sales data from all of their locations in the United States from 2019. This data shows previous sales in locations that were operating in 2019 and also gives us several variables that could potentially explain sales.   As a data analyst, we must construct econometric models to forecast revenue potential of retail sites for Timmy Tom’s.
